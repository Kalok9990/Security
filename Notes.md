# Introduction
This is notes to learn about how security is checked within software testing and security development lifecycle

##Principles

1. **Ensure Security by Designing**
    * Designed from the start, protecting itself and information being processed
    * Resistant to attacks
2. **Ensure Security by Default**
    * Default state minimizes possible risks of attacks
3. **Ensure Security while Deployment**
    * Software needs to be shipped - includes manuals and documentations
    * Easy to update and install
4. **Communications**
    * Open and responsible communications needed with consumer - in case of vulnerabilities are found, therefore proactive measures can be communicated
